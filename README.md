>I am just starting this so everything is messy and janky.

## Install

>‼️ CAUTION‼️

> ensure you change the configs to suit your needs
> change the hostname and username in .nix

you can check for username(tay) and hostname(tayvall) locations with the `rg` command. Example `rg --hidden "what to search for"`. if rg is not installed run `nix-shell -p ripgrep` to temporarily install it

1. temporarily install git with ``nix-shell -p git`` and clone this repository using `sudo git clone https://github.com/Tayvall/NixoRice/` then cd into the cloned repository `cd NixoRice`

2. ensure you remove my `harware-configuration.nix` and replace it with yours. remove it with `sudo rm -r hardware-configuration.nix` while inside the cloned repository. Then generate your `harware-configuration.nix` with `nixos-generate-config .#` inside the repository.

3. The .config folder should also be placed in the respective `$HOME/your-username/.config` file path with `sudo mv -r .config $HOME/your-username/`. The .nix files in `nixos/` should be moved to `/etc/nixos/`, do this with `sudo mv nixos/* /etc/nixos/`

4. once files are placed in the correct file paths run `sudo nixos-rebuild switch` to rebuild your system.

-- then just reboot with `reboot` and mess around with your new system!
