# NixOS Rice Configuration

My personal NixOS setup.

This is just a start at the moment and plan on creating a basic setup that looks good and can be used as a base starting point for beginners

## To-Do
- **Flakes** -modularize my config to allow easier configuration. (move to flakes).
- **HyperPanel** -add some more customization.
- **Clean Up** -remove unessesary configs and setups to keep a clean basis to later improve on.
